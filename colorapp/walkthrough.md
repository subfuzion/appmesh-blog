## Overview

This brief guide will walk you through deploying the Color App on ECS. The process has been automated using shell scripts and [AWS CloudFormation] templates to make deployment straightforward and repeatable.

Core networking and compute infrastructure doesn't need to be recreated each time the Color App is redeployed. Since this is the most time-consuming aspect of a full deployment, resource provisioning is divided among a layered set of CloudFormation stack templates.

The App Mesh deployment is also partitioned into different stages as well, but this for for performance reasons since App Mesh operations are very fast. The reason for the separation is simply so you can tear down the Color App without tearing down the demo mesh in case you also have other sample apps running in it for experimentation.

Each template has a corresponding shell script with a `.sh` extension that you run to create the CloudFormation stack. These scripts relay on environment variables values, described in following sections, that you must set before running.

**Infrastructure templates:**

* `examples/infrastructure/vpc.yaml` - creates the VPC and other core networking resources needed for the application independent of the specific compute environment (e.g., ECS) provisioned for cluster.
* `examples/infrastructure/ecs-cluster.yaml` - creates the compute instances and other resources needed for the cluster.
* `examples/infrastructure/appmesh-mesh.yaml` - creates an App Mesh mesh.

**Application resource templates:**

* `examples/apps/colorapp/ecs/ecs-colorapp.yaml` - deploys application services and related resources for the Color App.
* `examples/apps/colorapp/ecs/servicemesh/appmesh-colorapp.yaml` - creates mesh resources for the Color App.

## Prerequisites

1. You have version `1.16.124` or higher of the [AWS CLI] installed.

2. Your [AWS CLI configuration] has a `default` or named profile and valid credentials.

3. You have an [Amazon EC2 Key Pair] that you can use to log into your EC2 instances.

4. You have cloned the [github.com/aws/aws-app-mesh-examples] repo and changed directory to the project root.

## Deploy infrastructure for the application

### Create the VPC and other core Infrastructure

An [Amazon Virtual Private Cloud] (VPC) is a virtual network that provides isolation from other applications in other networks running on AWS. The following CloudFormation template will be used to create a VPC for our mesh sample applications:

`examples/infrastructure/vpc.yaml`

Set the following environment variables:

* `AWS_PROFILE` should be set to a profile that you've configured for the AWS CLI (either `default` or a named profile).
* `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` should be set to a region from the supported regions shown previously.
* `ENVIRONMENT_NAME` will be used as a prefix for the CloudFormation stacks that you will deploy.

Run the `vpc.sh` script to create a VPC for the application in the region you specify. It will be configured for two availability zones (AZs); each AZ will be configured with a public and a private subnet. You can choose to from one of the nineteen [Currently available AWS regions for App Mesh]. The deployment will include an [Internet Gateway] and a pair of [NAT Gateways] (one in each AZ) with default routes for them in the private subnets.

***Create the VPC***

`examples/infrastructure/vpc.sh`

```
$ export AWS_PROFILE=default
$ export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2
$ export ENVIRONMENT_NAME=DEMO
$ ./examples/infrastructure/vpc.sh
...
+ aws --profile default --region us-west-2 cloudformation deploy --stack-name DEMO-vpc --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM --template-file examples/infrastructure/vpc.yaml --parameter-overrides EnvironmentName=DEMO 
Waiting for changeset to be created..
Waiting for stack create/update to complete
...
Successfully created/updated stack - DEMO-vpc
$
```

### Create an App Mesh

[AWS App Mesh] is a service mesh (a logical boundary for network traffic between services that reside in it) that provides application-level networking support, standardizing how you control and monitor your services across multiple types of compute infrastructure. The following CloudFormation template will be used to create an App Mesh mesh for our application:

`examples/infrastructure/appmesh-mesh.yaml`

We will use the same environment variables from the previous step, plus one additional one (`MESH_NAME`), to deploy the stack using a script (`appmesh-mesh.sh`).

* `MESH_NAME` should be set to the name you want to use to identify the mesh. For this demo, we will call it `appmesh-mesh`.

***Create the mesh***

`examples/infrastructure/appmesh-mesh.sh`

```
$ ./examples/infrastructure/appmesh-mesh.sh
...
+ aws --profile default --region us-west-2 cloudformation deploy --stack-name DEMO-appmesh-mesh --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM --template-file /home/ec2-user/projects/aws/aws-app-mesh-examples/examples/infrastructure/appmesh-mesh.yaml --parameter-overrides EnvironmentName=DEMO AppMeshMeshName=appmesh-mesh

Waiting for changeset to be created..
Waiting for stack create/update to complete
...
Successfully created/updated stack - DEMO-appmesh-mesh
$
```

At this point we have now created our networking resources (VPC and App Mesh), but we have not yet deployed:

* compute resources to run our services on
* mesh configuration for our services
* actual services

### Create compute resources

Our infrastructure requires compute resources to run our services on. The following CloudFormation template will be used to create these resources for our application:

`examples/infrastructure/ecs-cluster.yaml`

In addition to the previous defined environment variables, you will also need to export the following:

* `SERVICES_DOMAIN` - this is the domain under which services in the mesh will be discovered. For this demo, we will use `demo.local`. In this demo, the colorgateway virtual service will send requests to the colorteller virtual service at `colorteller.demo.local`.
* `KEY_PAIR_NAME` - this is your EC2 keypair that you can use to ssh into your EC2 instances, allowing you to test your routing without configuring a public ALB to the application frontend.
 
You can also override the demo script's default cluster size (5) by setting `CLUSTER_SIZE`:

* `CLUSTER_SIZE` - the number of EC2 instances to provision for the ECS cluster (the demo script will default to 5).

***Create the ECS cluster***

`examples/infrastructure/ecs-cluster.sh`

```
$ ./examples/infrastructure/ecs-cluster.sh
...
+ aws --profile default --region us-west-2 cloudformation deploy --stack-name DEMO-ecs-cluster --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM --template-file /home/ec2-user/projects/aws/aws-app-mesh-examples/examples/infrastructure/ecs-cluster.yaml --parameter-overrides EnvironmentName=DEMO KeyName=tony_devbox2 ECSServicesDomain=demo.local ClusterSize=5

Waiting for changeset to be created..
Waiting for stack create/update to complete
...
Successfully created/updated stack - DEMO-ecs-cluster
$
```

### Review

You have provisioned the infrastructure you need. You can confirm in the AWS Console that all of your CloudFormation stacks have been successfully deployed. You should see something like this:
